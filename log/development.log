AWS::Errors::MissingCredentialsError (
Missing Credentials.

Unable to find AWS credentials.  You can configure your AWS credentials
a few different ways:

* Call AWS.config with :access_key_id and :secret_access_key

* Export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to ENV

* On EC2 you can run instances with an IAM instance profile and credentials
  will be auto loaded from the instance metadata service on those
  instances.

* Call AWS.config with :credential_provider.  A credential provider should
  either include AWS::Core::CredentialProviders::Provider or respond to
  the same public methods.

= Ruby on Rails

In a Ruby on Rails application you may also specify your credentials in
the following ways:

* Via a config initializer script using any of the methods mentioned above
  (e.g. RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers/aws-sdk.rb).

* Via a yaml configuration file located at RAILS_ROOT/config/aws.yml.
  This file should be formated like the default RAILS_ROOT/config/database.yml
  file.
